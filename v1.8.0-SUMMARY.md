# YOLO Yacht Search v1.8.0 - Release Summary

## 🎉 Version 1.8.0 Successfully Deployed!

**Release Date:** November 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and pushed to GitHub  
**Completion:** ~92% (search/browse features complete, booking flow remaining)

---

## ✨ What's New in v1.8.0

### 1. 📅 Date Picker Initialization Fixed
**Problem:** When clicking a yacht from search results, the date picker on the details page was empty.

**Solution:** Added complete Litepicker initialization that reads `dateFrom` and `dateTo` from URL parameters and sets the initial date range.

**Result:** Date picker now correctly shows the dates you selected during search!

### 2. 🔄 Date Picker Updates with Carousel
**Problem:** Clicking a week in the price carousel didn't update the date picker.

**Solution:** Created a global `updateDatePicker()` function that the carousel can call to update the date range.

**Result:** Date picker now updates instantly when you click a different week in the price carousel!

### 3. 📊 Extras in One Row
**Problem:** Optional and Obligatory extras were in separate sections, taking up too much vertical space.

**Solution:** Combined extras into a single section with a responsive two-column layout.

**Result:** 
- Desktop: Two columns side-by-side (Obligatory left/red, Optional right/blue)
- Mobile: Columns stack vertically for easy reading
- Color-coded headings for quick identification

### 4. ✅ Equipment Section Confirmed
**Status:** Equipment section was already present and working correctly with the heading "What kind of equipment do you get?"
