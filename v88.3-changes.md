# Version 89.9.3 Changes - Mobile Filter Fixes and Checkbox Alignment

## Summary
This release focuses on fixing critical CSS issues in the search results page, specifically addressing the broken equipment checkbox styling and implementing a comprehensive fix for the mobile filter layout to prevent horizontal scrolling and ensure proper input sizing.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Equipment Checkbox Alignment Fix (v89.8)
- **Problem:** Equipment checkboxes were visually broken due to conflicting CSS, appearing as large, unstyled boxes.
- **Fix:** Implemented a robust CSS solution using maximum specificity selectors to override conflicting theme styles, ensuring the custom checkbox design is correctly rendered and aligned with the label text.
- **File:** `public/css/search-results.css`

### 2. Comprehensive Mobile Filter Layout Fix (v89.9.1)
- **Problem:** On mobile devices, the advanced filter section caused horizontal scrolling, and filter inputs were too narrow, leading to truncated text (e.g., "M..." for Min/Max).
- **Fix:** Implemented a new set of mobile-specific CSS rules to ensure the filter container is constrained to the viewport width, and all filter groups stack vertically with full-width inputs.
- **Key Changes:**
    - Added `overflow-x: hidden !important` to relevant containers.
    - Forced `flex-direction: column !important` for filter rows.
    - Ensured all filter inputs and Select2 containers are `width: 100% !important`.
- **File:** `public/css/search-results.css`

### 3. Improved Dropdown Arrow Styling (v89.9.1)
- **Problem:** The default Select2 dropdown arrows were small and poorly aligned on mobile.
- **Fix:** Custom CSS was added to increase the size and improve the alignment of the Select2 dropdown arrows for better touch usability and visual appeal.
- **File:** `public/css/search-results.css`

### 4. Full-Width Range Inputs on Mobile (v89.9.3)
- **Problem:** The Min/Max range inputs (Year Built, Length, Price) were still displaying side-by-side on mobile, causing them to be too narrow and truncating text.
- **Fix:** Removed the conflicting CSS rule that forced range inputs to a fixed percentage width, and updated the mobile layout to stack the Min and Max inputs vertically, making them full width for better readability. The range separator (`-`) is now hidden on mobile.
- **File:** `public/css/search-results.css`
