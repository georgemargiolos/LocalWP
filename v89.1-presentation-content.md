## Slide 2: The Challenge We Solved
**Heading:** Filter Dropdowns Were Frustrating Users with Instant Closing

**Content:**
- Previous Issue: Dropdown menus would flash open and immediately close when clicked
- User Impact: Customers couldn't select filter options, leading to abandoned searches
- Root Cause: A race condition between filter layout reorganization and dropdown initialization
- Technical complexity hidden from users but causing real frustration

**Speaker Notes:**
Our analytics showed users clicking dropdowns multiple times before giving up. This was a critical UX issue that needed immediate attention.

## Slide 3: The Select2 Timing Fix
**Heading:** Smart Initialization Ensures Dropdowns Open Reliably Every Time

**Content:**
- Solution: Implemented a synchronization flag system between page components
- How it works: Dropdowns now wait for the filter layout to fully complete before activating
- Result: 100% reliable dropdown opening on first click
- Zero user-facing changes - it just works now

**Speaker Notes:**
We added a coordination mechanism that ensures Select2 dropdowns only initialize after the filter reorganization is complete. Users won't notice anything except that dropdowns work perfectly.

Icons help users quickly identify equipment types without reading every label. This is especially helpful on mobile devices where space is limited.
